h3 The Pain-Point
p These days, Peninsula Press reporters are reporting using mobile tools and platforms. Peninsula Press currently only showcases Vine, Instagram and Twitter posts using social media presences. This social content is fairly absent from PeninsulaPress.com, with the exception of a small Twitter feed.

h3 The Idea
p Similar to what was showcased in class, I'd like to build a map for PeninsulaPress.com that will highlight our Instagram posts by geographic location. The nice thing is it will put everything in context of our coverage area. It also creates an archive for our social posts that would otherwise disappear in the social noise.

h3 The Proposed Solution
p I'd propose utilizing Instagram's API to make this work. The endpoints of interest would be users (to pull posts from Peninsula Press' account) and location (which would help generate the information for the map). For the map foundation, I'd envision either using a simple Google Map or one of Stamen Design's open-sourced designs. An additional goal -- though not of utmost importance right now -- would be for the aesthetic to match Peninsula Press' branding and look.

p The challenge will be figuring out manual lat/long placement for our Instagram posts that are not geotagged. Moving forward, we can make geotagging mandatory to avoid this issue.
